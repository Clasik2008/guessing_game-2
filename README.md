Tic-Tac-Toe

O and X players alternate. In each turn, the player selects a cell from a 3x3 grid to place his or her mark. The selection is made with the number keys:

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

The game ends when one player completes three cells across, three cells down, or three cells diagonally. If the board is filled without any of these conditions being satisfied, the game is a tie.
